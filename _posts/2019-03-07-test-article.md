# **Standing on God’s Promises**

So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

(Isaiah 41:10)

All throughout the Word of God, scripture after scripture we are told we can trust God. In fact not only does the Word tell us that we can trust Him but it also tell us we can depend on Him and be assured that He is with us. Of course, when we are in the middle of battle and it seems like every dart the enemy owns has been thrown at us we can certainly get discouraged and even go as far as questioning God’s whereabouts however, this does not move God. One of His many promises is that He is with us, He has not left us, and He will never forsake us (Deut. 31:6 paraphrased), we can certainly stand strong on that.

Now that we know we can trust God and that He will be right in the fire with us we should also know that He has provided tools / weapons for us to use against the attack of the enemy. We have all that we need, we just have to be willing to use it, stand strong and watch God.  



Be Blessed,

Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer. (Psalms 19:14-KJV)





**Pray for the Peace of Israel**

“I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you." (Gen 12:3) 

“IF AMERICA DOES NOT DEFEND ISRAEL, GOD WILL NOT DEFEND AMERICA”.     John Hagee



**Verses to ponder:** 	

When you’re situation looks impossible meditate on Luke 18:27 “All things are possible”

When you’re feeling anxious find comfort in Psalms 46:10 “Be still and know that I am God”.

When you think you are all alone in your mess remember Hebrews 13:5 “I will never leave you nor forsake you”

When you say God I’m just not able – God say’s “I am able”(II Cor 9:8) “Cast all your cares on me” ( I Peter 5:7) “I will direct your path” (Proverbs 3:5-6) “I will give you wisdom” (I Cor 1:30) and “I will supply all of your needs” (Phil 4:19)
